      follows:
    a. Customer should be store in ~/fredData/MM
    b. The fredData folder should be divided by months (01, 02, .. 12)
    c. Your script should verify if the folder structure exists. If it is not available, then your
      script should be able to create it.

      /home/hvalle/submit/cs3030/files/FRED.csv

      folder. For example, if you are retrieving a file during the month of September, the
      file should be place in the ~/fredData/09 folder.

      FRED.csv.YYYY-MM-DD all based on the current timestamp

      should be taken as options to your program using getopts.

      customerâ€™s server to avoid the password exchange.
5. Finally, you need to use git to locally or remotely source control your script.
    a. You need to redirect the output from a $ git log > file.log
    b. Your log file must follow the same naming convention required for the assignment
